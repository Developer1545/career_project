                        <p>At WCSU a GPA of <b>3.0</b> is required  to get in. SAT test scores are
                            optional. Students who submit without SAT scores must comply with slightly
                            different standards such as having a B average in all classes. You also need 
                            to submit other things like letters of recommendation and your first quarter
                            senior year grades. As with RIT, WCSU also looks at your transcript and
                            allows credit for many AP classes taken in High School.

                            RIT also would like you to be above average in many of your classes
                            which means that you will need mostly As and Bs. If you show you took AP
                            classes, it shows you challeged yourself more which means RIT may accept a
                            lower GPA. You also have to submit either ACT or SAT scores. Although with the
                            SATs there is really no lowest score, the majority who apply score at least a

                            It depends on the job you are doing. For example, an AWS Developer-Associate Certification
                            means that the programmer will have further knowledge working on Amazon's AWS system.
                            Below are common certifications and their cost.

                            say they are worth having. Anyone who has had experience working with or is going
                            to be working with  Amazon's AWS services will find this certificate useful.

                            I will definitely start looking in schools within the near future. I want to widen
                            my options besides the two up top. To get here, I will probably need letters of
                            recommendation to apply to certain colleges. Furthermore, I will also start
                            to look at scholarships associated with certain schools and other programs. Once 
                            I get into a school I can start my journey to getting my degree in computer science. 
                            Towards my third or fourth year I want to begin to apply for interships. I believe,
                            especially with computer science, experience will help play a big role in apply for
                            jobs in the future. For interships, I will also need letters of recommendation and
                            I will have to go through interviews.<b> One of my top goals is to have a job lined up 
                            for after I leave college, maybe from an intership. </b>

                           One company I have in mind is Factset. Factset creates data and analytical software
                           for clients so they have easy access to financial data. Getting a job here in my opinion
                           would be super cool because I could not only persue programming but I also could work with
                           financial data such as stock data, another thing I enjoy doing. Another company that
                           interests me is IBM.
