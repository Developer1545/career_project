                        <p>At WCSU a GPA of <b>3.0</b> is required  to get in. SAT test scores are
                            optional. Students who submit without SAT scores must comply with slightly
                            different standards such as having a B average in all classes. You also need 
                            to submit other things like letters of recommendation and your first quarter
                            senior year grades. As with RIT, WCSU also looks at your transcript and
                            allows credit for many AP classes taken in High School.

                            RIT also would like you to be above average in many of your classes
                            which means that you will need mostly As and Bs. If you show you took AP
                            classes, it shows you challeged yourself more which means RIT may accept a
                            lower GPA. You also have to submit either ACT or SAT scores. Although with the
                            SATs there is really no lowest score, the majority who apply score at least a 
                            <b>1300 </b>on the SAT. A degree could take up to 4 or 5 years.

                            It depends on the job you are doing. For example, an AWS Developer-Associate Certification
                            means that the programmer will have further knowledge working on Amazon's AWS system.
                            Below are common certifications and their cost.

                            to be working with  Amazon's AWS services will find this certificate useful.

                        <p>Many programmers learn by teaching themseleves through apps, online tutorials and books.
                            Learning own your own is usually cheap and you can pace yourself. Steve Wozniak, the cofounder
                            of Apple was self taught. In fact many of the popular names in tech learned to program on their
                            own at a young age! It is very easy to be a self taught programmer nowadays because of the interent. There are hours of youtube videos for learning to program all on Youtube for free!

                            something else related. Many degrees under the computer science umbrella will have
                            some sort of programming you will learn. Going to collge though will not only allow you
                            to learn to program, you will also learn about the concepts in computer sciene like how
                            certain maths apply in certain areas.
