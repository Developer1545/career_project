                            RIT also would like you to be above average in many of your classes
                            which means that you will need mostly As and Bs. If you show you took AP
                            classes, it shows you challeged yourself more which means RIT may accept a
                            lower GPA. You also have to submit either ACT or SAT scores. Although with the
                            SATs there is really no lowest score, the majority who apply score at least a

                        <p>Programming teaches you how to solve problems. Programmers solve problems
                            by developing algorithms. They refine these algorithms until their problem can
                            be solved and it can be solved efficiently. Programmers learn to be problem solvers
                            and furthermore can apply these learned skills to their daily lives.

                        <p>Many programmers learn by teaching themseleves through apps, online tutorials and books.
                            Learning own your own is usually cheap and you can pace yourself. Steve Wozniak, the cofounder
                            of Apple was self taught. In fact many of the popular names in tech learned to program on their
                            own at a young age! It is very easy to be a self taught programmer nowadays because of the interent. There are hours of youtube videos for learning to program all on Youtube for free!

                            typically go for a software engineering degree, a computer science degree, or 
                            something else related. Many degrees under the computer science umbrella will have
                            some sort of programming you will learn. Going to collge though will not only allow you
                            to learn to program, you will also learn about the concepts in computer sciene like how
                            certain maths apply in certain areas.
